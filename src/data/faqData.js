        question: "What is homebear and what services do you offer?",
        answer: "homebear specializes in smart home automation solutions that run 100% locally in your home. We offer comprehensive services including lighting automation, climate control, security systems, energy monitoring, and custom automation scenarios. Everything is managed through a single, unified platform without relying on external cloud services."
      },
      {
        question: "How is homebear different from other smart home companies?",
        answer: "homebear stands out in three key ways:\n1. 100% local operation - no cloud dependency, ensuring privacy and reliability;\n2. One unified platform instead of multiple apps;\n3. Built on proven, future-proof technologies like Zigbee, Thread, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi that ensure long-term compatibility."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need an internet connection for my smart home to work?",
        answer: "No! That's one of homebear's biggest strengths. All your automations run locally on your home network, so your system keeps working even without internet. While an internet connection is needed to fetch useful data like traffic, weather, and other information that enhances your dashboards and overall experience, as well as for remote access, setup, and updates, everything in your home remains fully functional without it. Even if your internet goes down, you can still control all your devices locally, and your lights, thermostats, and automations will continue to run seamlessly."

      },
      {
        question: "Will installation require major renovations?",
        answer: "Installations are non-invasive. We primarily use wireless protocols that don't require running new wires through walls. For lighting and switches, we work with your existing electrical infrastructure. Any necessary modifications are discussed and approved before work begins."
